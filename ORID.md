Objective: Today, I learned how to manage global state in React using useContext.

Reflective: This was the first time this week I was able to keep up with the pace of the class.
        I felt a great sense of achievement because it marked a significant progress in my learning journey.

Interpretive: I realized that the key to becoming more efficient in React programming lies in thoroughly 
        understanding and memorizing the functionalities, parameters, and return values of the APIs. 
        This deep approach to learning helps me grasp the technology faster and keep up with the class pace better.

Decisional: To further enhance my React skills, I plan to continue studying more APIs and strengthen my practical experience by writing actual code. 
        Also, I will keep up with the course to ensure I can timely absorb and apply new knowledge.
